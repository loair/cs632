This code is about a classic deep learning problem - cats and dogs, which is to train a model to classify pictures as a dog or cat correctly. The image size is 32 * 32, and the dataset includes 10000 instances. The datasets is divided randomly as two parts, training data, and viladation data. Training data includes 8000 instances, while vildation data including 2000. 

The method used here is convolutional neural network. And the summary for the model is shown below:
